			<p>Tony Maniaty is an internationally known Penguin author, journalist and media coach. He had published four books, with Penguin. (Seeing his first novel with the Penguin logo was a special moment.) The themes of his work arise largely from his experience - what's the point of having a life if you're not going to write about it? - and his time as a correspondent: exploring the impacts of war and upheaval, displacement and migration. He is currently working on a cycle of novels about refugees. His blog explores these topics, as well as the cultural spaces he enjoy: cinema, journalism, history, biography, photography, architecture and design, travel, music and - naturally - writing and literature, in all its wonderful forms.</p>
